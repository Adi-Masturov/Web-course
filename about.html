    <h1> About </h1>
    <div>
        I am currently a third-year student studying at Tel Aviv University. <br>
        Throughout my degree, I was most interested in the course "Computer Science Introduction", <br>
        as a result, I decided to start broadening my horizons and expanding my knowledge regarding similar topics, independently and outside of the scope of my degree. <br>
        I learned via She Codes, Udemy, and courses on YouTube. <br>
        She Codes has taught me a great deal and to do my part, I decided to volunteer there as a mentor.
        <span> I am full of motivated and have high self-lerning ability. </span> 
        <p>
            via shecodes I learn HTML from these videos:
